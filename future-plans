Write c++ module which could be called from python. Maybe writing(understanding) some format method for string would be a good start. (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3101/)

Understand "{0!r:20}".format("Hello"). (https://wiki.python.org/moin/Py3kStringFormatting)

Read pydoc (/usr/bin/pydoc) and understand.

ctrl + l clears out the console. How I could find the all the default key bindings in my Mac?
